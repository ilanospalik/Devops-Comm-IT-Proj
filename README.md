# Comm-IT-Project README

**Application Description**

This web application is designed for comm-it, providing a service accessible via HTTPS from anywhere. The application follows a specific flow and utilizes various AWS services for its functionality.

**Application Flow**

1. **User Authentication:** Users access the frontend hosted on API Gateway and authenticate using their username and password through Amazon Cognito.

2. **Database Record:** Upon successful authentication, the application writes the user's information (username and date-time) into a DynamoDB table.

3. **S3 File Creation:** The application creates a file in an S3 bucket named after the authenticated user, with the content being the current time.

4. **Logging:** Both successful and failed authentication attempts are logged in CloudWatch, providing visibility into the application's activity.

5. **User Greeting:** After the above steps, the application responds with a message saying "Hello, [username]", warmly welcoming the user that get it from the Parameter Store.

**How to Use**

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. Set up an AWS account and configure your credentials using the AWS CLI.

4. Create an Amazon Cognito user pool and an app client to enable user authentication.

5. Create a DynamoDB table to store user information.

6. Create an S3 bucket to store files generated by the application.

7. Deploy the frontend on API Gateway, ensuring the necessary routes are set up.

8. Implement the Lambda function in JavaScript or Node.js to perform CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table and create files in the S3 bucket.

9. Deploy the Lambda function on AWS and configure it to trigger upon API Gateway requests.

10. Use the application by accessing the API Gateway frontend and logging in with your username and password.
